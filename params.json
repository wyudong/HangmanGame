Welcome to this page for introducing and archiving my Strikingly interview project - a word-guessing game on iOS.\r\n\r\n## Walkthrough\r\n\r\nMy project is base on the MVC design pattern.\r\n\r\n### Model\r\n\r\nThe model `RESTfulAPIManager` interacts with the HTTP connection and implements all the given APIs in 5  Objective-C methods with completion handlers. Another model `HMString` is a subclass of `NSString`, which reads each character of a word and replace it with other characters. And `HMGameMangaer` has jut one shared instance telling the program if player wants to start a new game or continue the last saved game.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n## Difficulties I encountered and how do I resolve them\r\n\r\n## Big thanks\r\n\r\nThank you very much for giving me such a special interview opportunity. I will never forget the intense but meaningful development time lasted 4 days. Hope you enjoy my work as I do.
