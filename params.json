{"name":"HangmanGame","tagline":"Strikingly Interview Project","body":"# HangmanGame\r\n\r\nWelcome to this page for introducing and archiving my Strikingly interview project: a word-guessing game on iOS.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** you need a valid player ID for starting the game. The ID can be found below, but I'm not sure whether it might get expired someday.\r\n\r\n## Walkthrough\r\n\r\nMy project is base on the MVC design pattern.\r\n\r\n### Model\r\n\r\n- `RESTfulAPIManager` interacts with the HTTP connection and implements all the given APIs in five Objective-C methods with completion handlers.\r\n\r\n- `HMString` is a subclass of `NSString`, which reads each character of a word and replaces it with other characters.\r\n\r\n- `HMGameMangaer` has just one shared instance telling the program whether the player wants to start a new game or continue the last saved game.\r\n\r\n### View\r\n\r\nI define my own category and subclass of [FlatUIKit](https://github.com/Grouper/FlatUIKit) and [MBProgressHUD](https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD) to customize my UI components, such as labels, buttons, text field and progress HUD.\r\n\r\n### Controller\r\n\r\n- HMWelcomeViewController has three parts.\r\n    - Enter your player ID in the text field.\r\n    - Touch **NEW GAME** button to start a new game, and this will reset all the saved data.\r\n    - Touch **CONTINUE** button to continue your last game.\r\n\r\n- HMGuessViewController is for guessing the word and getting the result.\r\n    - Submit your guessing letter with the customized keyboard.\r\n    - Check the progress of the current word and some other stats after every guess.\r\n    - Quit the game or submit your score.\r\n\r\n## Difficulties that I encountered and how do I resolve them\r\n\r\n### HTTP request\r\n\r\nBefore the task, I have never written code to request data via HTTP. The only library I used to deal with the network when developing iOS App is [LeanCloud](https://leancloud.cn/). However, I just know some basic APIs, nothing more in lower level.\r\n\r\nSo the first thing I do is to learn what RESTful web service is and how to send and receive JSON package. I read an [article](http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/restful-web-services-a-tutorial/240169069?pgno=1) and manage to send request using both the terminal and an Chrome extension named [Advanced REST client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo/reviews?hl=en-US&utm_source=ARC). An hour later, I finally understand the whole game flow and the HTTP request and response that I need to finish the game.\r\n\r\n### Customized keyboard\r\n\r\nI want to impress people when playing my game but the default keyboard of iOS which looks dull doesn't meet my requirement, and some keys are redundant for guessing a word. So I decide to design a customized keyboard.\r\n\r\nI really have little time to learn [Custom Keyboard of App Extension](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Keyboard.html) provided by Apple, so the dirty method I come up with is to simulate a keyboard with tons of `UIButton`. Another thing pissed me off is how to auto layout theses buttons. At last, I make it works and it could be worse :)\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5687273/9426908/f1b108fc-4990-11e5-9ac4-ccfa134e6e60.png)\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- > Can I play the game without a player ID?\r\n\r\n  > What if I continue the game with a different player ID?\r\n\r\n The answer is NO. And I have also prepared some nice tips for handling these kinds of uncommon behaviour and server error. Find more funny tips as you find the bugs.\r\n\r\n- Every time you make a guess, the word will shake its body to cheer you up!\r\n\r\n- The keyboard, obviously the one in the second view.\r\n\r\n- The App name: **H_ngm_n**. Wait, is it an English word?\r\n\r\n- Simple but elegant UI with the help of [FlatUIKit](https://github.com/Grouper/FlatUIKit).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5687273/9717017/b7aaf1be-55a1-11e5-8352-d7dc23eaf5c0.png)\r\n*Welcome*\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5687273/9704669/515ded8c-54e1-11e5-80ae-390123855144.png)\r\n*Noob entering ID*\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5687273/9704670/6982bfc8-54e1-11e5-9f91-3a94a5da08cb.gif)\r\n*Shake it*\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5687273/9704675/9be902ec-54e1-11e5-8bc5-04620703135d.png)\r\n*Noob testing button*\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5687273/9727397/392c76f6-5631-11e5-952d-788219bcfafc.png)\r\n*Yay!*\r\n\r\n## Big thanks\r\n\r\nThank you very much for giving me such a special interview opportunity. I will never forget the intense but meaningful development time lasted 4 days. Hope you enjoy my work as I do. For more fun, please try another iOS game made by me, [7 Light Year](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/7-light-year/id1025658330?mt=8).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
